The Manager receives the log. Its sshd decoder parses the log into structured fields (e.g., `src_ip: "10.0.2.5", user: "maddy"`). The Manager then matches this decoded event to Rule 5760, generating a Level 5 alert.           |\n| SIEM         | Security Information and Event Management        |\n| SOAR         | Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response |\n    |\n     |\n| 2034 | 0.0   |\n
